# Arduino: A Technical Reference

The "ArdNut" repositories contain the source code, schematics, and PCB layous for the various projects
presented in the book "Arduino: A Technical Reference".

This respository will contain commentary, notes, and errata.

For project-specific technical details refer to the project repositories.

As I learn more about GitHub I will incorporiate more features into this set of repositories (I'm from
the world of RCS, CVS, and SVN, so some of GitHub's features are new to me). I also post things on my
technical blog from time to time. You can find that at: [Crankycode] (https://crankycode.wordpress.com/).
